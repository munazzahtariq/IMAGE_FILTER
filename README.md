# IMAGE_FILTER
Apply basic OpenCV image filters, color space conversions, edge detection, and face detection with interactive results.

#  IMAGE_FILTERS with OpenCV

A collection of basic image processing techniques using OpenCV. This project demonstrates how different filters and color transformations affect an image, along with face detection using Haar cascades.

---

##  Features

- **Blurring**  
  Apply standard blur and *Canny edge-preserving blur* to reduce noise while keeping important edges.

- **Edge Detection**  
  Use Canny edge detection to highlight object boundaries.

- **Color Space Conversions**
  - Grayscale
  - HSV
  - BGR
  - LAB

- **Face Detection**  
  Detect human faces in images using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascades.

##  Purpose

This repo is meant for:
- Practicing core OpenCV transformations
- Understanding how different filters and color spaces work
- Visualizing how each processing step affects an image
